# Build file  for GPSBabel.
# Makefile is generated from Makefile.in by configure which does several
# text substitutions such version numbers and object paths for us.

# GPSBabel requires a reasonably recent version of GNU Make.
# We rely on very few fancy features of make so the exact version
# probably doesn't much matter.  GNU Make 3.81 seems a reasonable target.
